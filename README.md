# Toast Component Project

## Joy of React, Project II

In this project, we'll dive deep into the implementation of a single common UI component: A `<Toast>` message component.

## Demo

## Getting Started

This project is created with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a modern JS build tool. It's intended to be run locally, on your computer, using Node.js and NPM.

To run a local development server, we first need to install third-party dependencies (eg. React, Parcel). This can be done by cd-ing into the root project folder and running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been downloaded, you can run a dev server with the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server.
